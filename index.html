<h1>Python script to download paychecks</h1>

<p>
ADP's website has some JSP craziness that only allows you to
view one paycheck at a time. Additionally, their notification emails
don't actually send you the paycheck, but rather just link to the site.
This python script (which I run as a cron job) takes arguments in the form:
<pre>python adp.py &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</pre> It scans
each year of paychecks and downloads any you're missing to the current
directory.
</p>

<p>
It is a total hack and may stop working, but you may also find it useful.
